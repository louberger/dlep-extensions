  This document defines an extension to the Dynamic Link Exchange
  Protocol (DLEP) that enables a DiffServ aware credit-window scheme for
  destination-specific and shared flow control.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
  The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in <xref
  target="RFC8175"/>.  The protocol provides the exchange of link
  related control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers consist of
  a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of mechanisms as well
  as support for possible extensions.  This document defines one such
  extension.
      </t>
      <t>
  The DLEP specification does not include any flow control capability.
  There are various flow control techniques theoretically possible with
  DLEP.  This document defines a DLEP extension which provides a
  DiffServ-based flow control mechanism for traffic sent from a router
  to a modem. Flow control is provided using one or more logical "Credit
  Windows", each of which will typically be supported by an associated
  virtual or physical queue.  A router will use traffic flow
  classification information provided by the modem to identify which
  traffic is associated with each credit window.  Credit windows may be
  shared or dedicated on a per-flow basis.  See <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-ether-credit-extension"/> for an
  Ethernet-based version of credit window flow control.  As specified in
  Section 2.3.1 of <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/>, when both
  DiffServ and Ethernet traffic classification are specified for a flow,
  the Ethernet information takes precedence.
      </t>
      <t>
  This document uses the traffic classification and credit window
  control mechanisms defined in <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/> to provide credit
  window based flow control based on DLEP destinations and DiffServ
  <xref target="RFC2475"/> DSCPs (differentiated services codepoints).
  The defined mechanism allows for credit windows to be shared across
  traffic sent to multiple DLEP destinations and DSCPs, or used
  exclusively for traffic sent to a particular destination and/or DSCP.
  The extension also supports the "wildcard" matching of any DSCP.
      </t>
      <t>
  The extension defined in this document is referred to as "DiffServ
  Aware Credit Window" or, more simply, the "DA Credit" extension. The
  reader should be familiar with both the traffic classification and
  credit window control mechanisms defined in <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
  This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value in <xref
  target="sec-ext-type"/> which is used to indicate support for the
  extension.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

      <name>Extension Usage and Identification</name>
      <t>
   The extension defined in this document is composed of the mechanisms
   and processing defined in <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.  To indicate that
   the DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension is to be used, an
   implementation MUST include the DiffServ Aware Credit Window Type
   Value in the Extensions Supported Data Item (see Section 13.6 of
   <xref target="RFC8175"/>).  The Extensions Supported Data Item is
   sent and processed according to <xref target="RFC8175"/>.  Any
   implementation that indicates use of the DiffServ Aware Credit Window
   Extension MUST support all Messages, Data Items, the DiffServ Traffic
   Classification Sub-Data Item, and all related processing defined in
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
   target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
  The DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension Type Value is TBA1, see
  <xref target="sec-iana"/>.

    <section anchor="sec-mgmnt" numbered="true">
      <name>Management Considerations</name>
      <t>
    This section provides several network management guidelines
    to implementations supporting the DiffServ Aware Credit Window
    Extension.
      </t>
      <t>
    If this extension is supported, that support MUST be declared using
    the Extensions Supported Data Item (see Section 13.6 of <xref
    target="RFC8175"/>). DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension Data
    Items MUST NOT be emitted by a DLEP participant unless such support
    was specified in the initialization message received from its peer.
    The use of the extension defined in this document SHOULD be
    configurable on both modems and routers.
      </t>
      <t>
    Modems SHOULD support the configuration of DSCP to credit
    window (queue) mapping.
      </t>
      <t>
    Modems MAY support the configuration of the number of credit
    windows (queues) to advertise to a router.
      </t>
      <t>
    Routers may have limits on the number of queues that they can
    support and limits on supported credit window combinations. Per
    destination queues might not be supported at all.  When
    modem-provided credit window information exceeds the capabilities of
    a router, the router SHOULD use a subset of the provided credit
    windows.  Alternatively, a router MAY reset the session and indicate
    that the extension is not supported.  In either case, the mismatch
    of capabilities SHOULD be reported to the user via normal network
    management mechanisms such as user interface messages or error
    logging.
      </t>
      <t>
    In all cases, if credit windows are in use, traffic for which
    credits are not available MUST NOT be sent to the modem by the
    router.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
    This document defines a DLEP extension that uses DLEP mechanisms and
    the credit window control and flow mechanisms defined in <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification"/> and <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control"/>.  See
    also the Security Considerations sections of those documents.
      </t>
      <t>
    The defined extension is exposed to vulnerabilities similar to
    existing DLEP messages and discussed in the Security Considerations
    section of <xref target="RFC8175"/> such as an injected message
    resizing a credit window to a value that results in a denial of
    service.  The security mechanisms documented in <xref
    target="RFC8175"/> can be applied equally to the mechanism defined
    in this document.
      </t>
      <t>
    Wildcards for matching Priority Code point (PCP) and VLAN ID (VID)
    fields (see <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-ether-credit-extension"/>) are provided
    which may be convenient to match a number of packet flows but could
    inadvertently match unexpected flows or new flows that appear after
    the wildcard matching has been set up. It is therefore RECOMMENDED
    that wildcards not be used unless needed.

     The Sub-Data item format was inspired by Rick Taylor's "Data Item
     Containers".  He also proposed the separation of credit windows from
     traffic classification at IETF 98. Many useful comments were
     received from contributors to the MANET working group, notably
     Ronald in't Velt.
      </t>
      <t>
     We had the honor of working too briefly with David Wiggins on this
     and related DLEP work. His contribution to the IETF and publication
     of the first and definitive open source DLEP implementation have
     been critical to the acceptance of DLEP. We mourn his passing on
     November 23, 2023.  We wish to recognize his guidance, leadership
     and professional excellence.  We were fortunate to benefit from his
     leadership and friendship. He shall be missed.
