      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
  The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  It provides the exchange of link
  related control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are
  comprised of a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of
  mechanisms as well as support for possible extensions.  This
  document defines one such extension.
</t>
      <t>
  The base DLEP specification does not include any flow control
  capability.  There are various flow control techniques theoretically possible
  with DLEP.
  This document defines a DLEP extension which provides a DiffServ-based
  flow control mechanism for traffic sent from a router to a modem. Flow
  control is provided using one or more logical "Credit Windows", each of
  which will typically be supported by an associated virtual or physical
  queue.  A router will use traffic flow classification
  information provided by the modem to identify which traffic is
  associated with each credit window.
  Credit windows may be shared or dedicated on a per flow basis.
  See <xref target="I-D.berger-manet-dlep-ether-credit-extension" format="default"/> for
  an Ethernet-based version of credit window flow control.
</t>
      <t>
  This document uses the traffic classification and credit window
  control mechanisms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/> to provide credit
  window based flow control based on DLEP destinations and DiffServ
  <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"/> DSCPs (differentiated services codepoints).
  The defined mechanism allows for credit windows to be shared across
  traffic sent to multiple DLEP destinations and DSCPs, or used
  exclusively for traffic sent to a particular destination and/or DSCP.
  The extension also supports the "wildcard" matching of any DSCP.
</t>
      <t>
  The extension defined in this document is referred to as "DiffServ
  Aware Credit Window" or, more simply, the "DA Credit" extension. The
  reader should be familiar with both the traffic classification and
  credit window control mechanisms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.
</t>
      <t>
  This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value in <xref target="sec-ext-type" format="default"/> which is used to indicate support for the
  extension.

   The extension defined in this document is composed of the mechanisms
   and processing defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.  To indicate that the
   DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension is to be used, an
   implementation MUST include the DiffServ Aware Credit Window Type
   Value in the Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions
   Supported Data Item is sent and processed according to <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  Any implementation that indicates use of the
   DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension MUST support all Messages,
   Data Items, the DiffServ Traffic Classification Sub-Data Item, and all
   related processing defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.

  The DiffServ Aware Credit Window Extension Type Value is TBA1, see

      <name>Management Considerations</name>
      <t>
    This section provides several network management guidelines
    to implementations supporting the DiffServ Aware Credit Window
    Extension.
      </t>
      <t>
    The use of the extension defined in this document SHOULD be
    configurable on both modems and routers.
      </t>
      <t>
    Modems SHOULD support the configuration of DSCP to credit
    window (queue) mapping.
      </t>
      <t>
    Modems MAY support the configuration of the number of credit
    windows (queues) to advertise to a router.
      </t>
      <t>
    Routers may have limits on the number of queues that they can
    support and, perhaps, even limits in supported credit window
    combinations, e.g., if per destination queues can even be
    supported at all.  When modem-provided credit window information
    exceeds the capabilities of a router, the router SHOULD use a subset of
    the provided credit windows.  Alternatively, a router MAY reset the
    session and indicate that the extension is not supported.  In either
    case, the mismatch of capabilities SHOULD be reported to the user via
    normal network management mechanisms, e.g., user interface or error
    logging.
      </t>
      <t>
    In all cases, if credit windows are in use, traffic for which credits are not
    available MUST NOT be sent to the modem by the router.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
    This document defines a DLEP extension that uses base DLEP
    mechanisms and the credit window control and flow mechanisms defined
    in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-traffic-classification" format="default"/> and
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.
    The defined extension exposes vulnerabilities similar to
    existing DLEP messages, e.g., an injected message resizes a credit
    window to a value that results in a denial of service.
    The security mechanisms documented in <xref target="RFC8175"
    format="default"/> can be applied equally to the mechanism defined in this document.

            <abstract>
              <t>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions. In mobile or other environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make the best decisions. This document introduces a new protocol called the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP), which provides a bidirectional, event-driven communication channel between the router and the modem to facilitate communication of changing link characteristics.</t>

     The Sub-Data item format was inspired by Rick Taylor's "Data Item
     Containers".  He also proposed the separation of credit windows from
     traffic classification at IETF98. Many useful comments were
     received from contributors to the MANET working group, notably
     Ronald in't Velt.

     We had the honor of working too briefly with David Wiggins on this
     and related DLEP work. His contribution to the IETF and publication
     of the first and definitive open source DLEP implementation have
     been critical to the acceptance of DLEP. We morn his passing on
     November 23, 2023.  We wish to recognize his guidance, leadership
     and professional excellence.  We were fortunate to benefit from his
     leadership and friendship. He shall be missed.
