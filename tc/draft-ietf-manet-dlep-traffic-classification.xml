      This document defines a new Data Item for the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) 
      to support traffic classification.  Traffic classification
      information identifies traffic flows based on
      frame/packet content such as destination address.  The Data Item
      is defined in an extensible and reusable fashion. Its use will be
      mandated in other documents defining specific DLEP extensions.
      This document also introduces DLEP Sub-Data Items, and Sub-Data
      Items are defined to support DiffServ and Ethernet traffic
      classification.

      <t>
      The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in <xref target="RFC8175" format="default"/>.  This protocol provides the exchange of link related
      control information between DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are comprised
      of a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of mechanisms as
      well as support for possible extensions.  DLEP defines Data Items
      which are sets of information that can be reused in DLEP
      messaging.  The DLEP specification does not include any flow
      identification beyond DLEP endpoints, i.e., flows are identified
      based on their DLEP endpoint.  
      </t>
      <t>This document defines DLEP
      Data Item formats which provide flow identification on a more
      granular basis.  Specifically, it enables a router
      to use traffic flow classification information provided by the
      modem to identify traffic flows based on a combination of
      information found in a data plane header. 
      (For general background on traffic classification see
      <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"/> Section 2.3.) 
      The Data Item is structured to
      allow for use of the defined traffic classification information
      with applications such as credit window control as specified in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.
      The credit window control document provides an
      example of combining traffic classification
      and credit window flow control.
       </t>
       <t>
      This document defines traffic classification based on a DLEP
      destination and flows identified by either DiffServ
      <xref target="RFC2475" format="default"/> 
      Differentiated Services Codepoints (DSCPs) or IEEE 
      802.1Q <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/> Ethernet 
       Priority Code Points (PCPs).
      The defined mechanism allows for flows to be described in
      a flexible fashion and when combined with applications such as
      credit window control, allows credit windows to be shared
      across traffic sent to multiple DLEP destinations and as part of
      multiple flows, or used
      exclusively for traffic sent to a particular destination and/or
      belonging to a particular flow.
      The extension also supports the "wildcard" matching of any flow (DSCP
      or PCP).  Traffic classification information is provided such that it
      can be readily extended to support other traffic classification
      techniques, or be used by non-credit window related extensions, such
      as <xref target="RFC8651" format="default"/> or even
      5-tuple IP flows.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document defines support for traffic classification using a
      single new Data Item in <xref target="sec-di-tc" format="default"/> for general
      support and two new Sub-Data Items are defined to support
      identification of flows based on DSCPs and PCPs.

      <t>
    The Traffic Classification Data Item represents a list of
    flows that may be used at the same time to provide
    different service classes 
    for traffic sent from a
    router to a modem.  The data plane information used to identify each
    flow is represented in a separate Sub-Data Item.  The Data Item and
    Sub-Data Item structure is intended to be independent of any
    specific usage of the flow identification, e.g., flow control.  The
    Sub-Data Item structure is also intended to allow for future traffic
    classification types, e.g., 5-tuple flows.  While the structure of
    the Data Items is extensible, actual flow information is expected to
    be used in an extension dependent manner. Support for DSCP and
    PCP-based flows are defined via individual Sub-Data Items
    below. Other types of flow identification, e.g., based on IP
    protocol and ports, may be defined in the future via new Sub-Data
    Items.  Note that when extensions supporting multiple Sub-Data Item
    types are negotiated, these types MAY be combined in a single Data Item.
      </t>
      <t>
    Each list of flows is identified
    using a "Traffic Classification Identifier" or "TID" and is expected
    to represent a valid combination of data plane identifiers that may
    be used at the same time.  Each flow is identified via a "Flow
    Identifier" or "FID".  Each FID is defined in a Sub-Data Item which
    carries the data plane identifier or identifiers used to associate
    traffic with the flow.  A DLEP destination address is also needed to
    complete traffic classification information used in extensions such
    as flow control.  This information is expected to be provided in an
    extension specific manner.  For example, this address can be provided
    by a modem when it identifies the traffic classification set in a
    Destination Up Message using the Credit Window Associate Data Item
    defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>.
    TID and FID values have modem-local scope.

        <name>Traffic Classification Data Item</name>
        <t>
      This section defines the Traffic Classification Data Item.  This
      Data Item is used by a modem to provide a router with traffic
      classification information.  When an extension requires use of
      any Data Item, the Data Items, including this Traffic Classification Data Item SHOULD be
      included by a modem in any Session Initialization Response Message, e.g., see 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>. 
                Updates to
      previously provided traffic classifications or new traffic
      classifications MAY be sent by a modem by including the Data Item
      in Session Update Messages.  More than one Data Item MAY be
      included in a message to provide information on multiple traffic
      classifiers.
        </t>
        <t>
      The set of traffic classification information provided in the data
      item is identified using a Traffic Classification Identifier, or
      TID.  The actual data plane related information used in traffic
      classification is provided in a variable list of Traffic
      Classification Sub-Data Items.

      MUST initialize a new information set using the values carried in
      the Data Item.  If the associated traffic classification information
      is found, the router MUST replace the corresponding information using the values
      carried in the Data Item.  In both cases, a router MUST also
      ensure that any data plane state, e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-credit-flow-control" format="default"/>, that is
      associated with the TID is updated as needed.

      The Ethernet Traffic Classification Sub-Data Item 
      identifies the VLAN and PCPs that should be treated as a single
      flow, i.e., receive the same traffic treatment.  Ethernet Priority
                Code Point support is defined as part of the IEEE 802.1Q 
                <xref target="IEEE8021Q" format="default"/> tag format and includes a 3 bit "PCP"
      field.  The tag format also includes a 12 bit VLAN identifier
      (VID) field. PCPs are identified in a list of priority fields.  An
      implementation that does not support PCPs and wants the same
      traffic treatment for all traffic to a destination or destinations
      would indicate 0 PCPs.  Such an implementation could identify a
      VLAN to use per destination.

          the number of Priority fields indicated by the NumPCPs

         This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
         Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
         Traffic Classification Sub-Data Item Type Values registry for
         the DLEP protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 and [RFC8126].
	</t>
	<t>
         This registry encompasses packet traffic classification, where
         standard packet header identifiers in packets or data frames
         indicate Quality of Service (QoS) treatment. It includes two
         specific registries for widely recognized identifiers used in
         QoS management for IP and Ethernet networks. Reserved values are
         set aside for similar future identifiers that may emerge to
         denote QoS treatment. However, requests for new entries are not
         expected to be frequent.
	</t>
	<t>
         Allocations within the registry are subject to the following
         requirements:
	</t>
        <ol>
	<li>
         Documentation of the intended use of the requested value, in
         compliance with the "Specification Required" policy defined in
         <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>.
	</li>
	<li>
	<t> Approval by the Designated Expert (DE) appointed by the IESG.
	The DE must: </t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
	<li>
	 Verify that the requested value is clearly documented and its
         purpose and usage are unambiguous.
	</li>
	<li>
         Ensure the proposed value does not conflict with existing work
         or ongoing efforts within the IETF.
	</li>
	<li>
         Confirm that any specification requesting a code point has
	undergone review by the MANET working group (or a successor mailing 
	list designated by the IESG).
	</li>
	<li>
         Validate that external specifications requesting code points are
         publicly available, permanently archived, and do not conflict
         with active or published IETF work.
	</li>
	<li>
         Ensure the review process is conducted in a timely manner, with
         any disputes resolved through consultation with the appropriate
         working groups.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ol>
	<t>
         To simplify future registrations, it is recommended that this
         guidance serves as a standard reference for all DLEP-related
         registries. Future specifications may include a header note pointing to this
	guidance document.

     The Sub-Data Item format was inspired by Rick Taylor's "Data Item
     Containers".  He also proposed the separation of credit windows
     from traffic classification at IETF98. Many useful comments were
     received from contributors to the MANET working group.  This
     document was derived from <xref target="I-D.ietf-manet-dlep-da-credit-extension" format="default"/> as a result of
     discussions at IETF 101. Many useful comments were
     received from contributors to the MANET working group, notably
     Ronald in't Velt and David Black.

        We had the honor of working too briefly with David Wiggins on
        this and related DLEP work. His contribution to the IETF and
        publication of the first and definitive open source DLEP
        implementation have been critical to the acceptance of DLEP. We
        mourn his passing on November 23, 2023.  We wish to recognize his
        guidance, leadership and professional excellence.  We were
        fortunate to benefit from his leadership and friendship. He
        shall be missed.
